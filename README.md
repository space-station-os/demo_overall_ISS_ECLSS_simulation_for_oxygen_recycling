# demo_overall_ISS_ECLSS_simulation_for_oxygen_recycling
## Simulation for recycling CO2 to produce O2 for crews
We have created a sample program for material circulation. The simulation focuses on the RECYCLING CO2 SYSTEM. which aims to quantify the production and release of oxygen (O2) and carbon dioxide (CO2). This model is based on the Daily Human Metabolic Load Profile, originally developed by NASA for their Crew Exploration program. Ref.

## RESULTS FOR MODEL IN PROCESS
Results will be given for a 30-day simulation where data is shown every hour. 
Results like CSV.
## FUNTIONS OF THE MODEL:
  -Material transfer.
  -Amount of substance in each device per hour.

## RUN THE SIMULATION
