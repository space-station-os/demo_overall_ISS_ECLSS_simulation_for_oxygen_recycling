## Simulation for recycling CO2 to produce O2 for crews

A Python-based simulation model has been developed, focusing on material circulation.
This simulation is focused on the RECYCLING CO2 SYSTEM, which aims to quantify the production and release of oxygen (O2) and carbon dioxide (CO2).


## DEVICES (Configuration):
Human,
Module,
Oxygen Tank,
Pure Water Small Tank,
Gray H2o To Pure H2o Recycling Processor,
Oxygen Recovery Processor,
Carbon Dioxide Separator,
Carbon Dioxide To H2O,
CO2 Removal System,
Vapor H2O Removal System,
Oxygen Production System,
SABATIER Processor.

## RESULTS FOR MODEL IN PROCESS
Results will be given for a 30-day simulation where data is shown every hour.<br /> 
Results like CSV.
## FUNTIONS OF THE MODEL
  -Material transfer,<br />
  -Amount of substance in each device per hour.

## RUN THE SIMULATION

Open Simulation Loop.py to run the Demo.
